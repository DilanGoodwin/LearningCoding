# Working With Lists

Within Scala lists are classified as objects of type `List[X]` where X can be any time. List are effective for recursive algorithms as it is easy to add elements head list & get tail list. 
Each of the problems within this section will have a file named after the problem number (example P01.scala) to make them easier to find. There may also be multiple different ways to achieve the same thing by different means so the document may contain these different ways.

## Easy
Each of these problems will use a list which will be included at the end of each of them.
For an extra challenge you can randomly generate a list for each of the problems & then apply the functions you have created to that.

* P01 - Find the last element of a list. `List(1,1,2,3,5,8)`
* P02 - Find the last but one element of a list. `List(1,1,2,3,5,8)`
* P03 - Find the nth element of a list. `List(1,1,2,3,5,8)`
* P04 - Find the number of elements of a list. `List(1,1,2,3,5,8)`
* P05 - Reverse a list. `List(1,1,2,3,5,8)`
* P06 Find out whether a list is a palindrome. `List(1,2,3,2,1)`
