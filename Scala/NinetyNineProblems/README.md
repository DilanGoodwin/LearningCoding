# Ninety Nine Scala Problems

There is a list of problems written by Werner Hett at Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland called 'Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems'.

A version of this list of problems has been edited by Phil Gold to be more workable within the Scala programming language (Link Here to the original webpage). I am going to go through these different problems coming up with solutions of each of them. However, for a single problem there may be multiple solutions so the programs created my have many different ways of getting to the same conclusion. If I can think of different ways to solve the problem then I will add them into the file. <\n><\n>
Each of the problems has a difficulty, in order to both maintain the different difficulties of each of the files I will split the single programs into different packages based on their difficulty.
