# Programming in Scala Fifth Edition

This is a textbook that I brought to help improve my Scala programming abilities. You will notice that there was a folder called University within this repository but there were only 2 modules for Scala programming so in order to learn more about the language I am going to be using the book Programming in Scala Fifth Edition by Martin Odersky; Lex Spoon; Bill Venners and Frank Sommers. I am not going to copy & paste the infomration from the textbook into that repository, I am just going to be detailing the different projects that are within the book & how I completed them or how the book decides to complete them.

## Chapter 1
