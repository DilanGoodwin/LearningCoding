# Scala Essential Training

The Scala Essential Training is a course on LinkedIn Learning that goes over the basics of the Scala language. It explains some of the basics that are part of the Scala language & is not great for people just starting out with programming but beneficial for people who know a little about programming & have already had a look at the Scala programming language. <\n><\n>

Within this file there are different sub-folders that hold the challenges for those specific sub-sections of the course. Each section of the course has a single challenge for the user to complete so that they can try out the different ideas shown within the given section. Along with the challenge the teacher also goes through the solution that she came up with for the challenge she presented. Do not worry if your solution is not the same as the teachers as each programmer has different ways of doing things & thinking about problems.
