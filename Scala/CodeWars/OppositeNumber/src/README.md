# Opposite Number
A simple Scala program that works out the opposite of the number entered by the user.

This program works by taking the number the user has inputted & then taking double away from itself. An example of this is shown below:

```
Please enter a number: 2
-2
```

The final answer is calculated using the formula: `x-(x*2)`
