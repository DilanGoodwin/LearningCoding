# Learning Coding

TLDR: GitHub Repository for storing different programs created while learning different programming languages.

Repository acting as a personal programming library for programs created while following different programming courses. Not really very useful for anyone other than myself but I saw no reason for it to stay private. It serves as a way for me to learn both more about Git, GitHub & different programming languages.

Each section will have a short README.md file that explains what it is & for each of the courses there will be explainations of how many sections there are, what the sections cover & my thoughts on the course (not that they really matter that much).

## Sections
* BashScripting
* C#
* Python3
* Scala

## Commit Messages
Early on in the creation of this Git Repo there was no structre to my commit messages & I would just create a commit every single day. Rather than doing that I am now going to provide a set of given messages that I can use to explain what the commit is which I can then further explain on in a secondary message.

Example `git commit -m"" -m""`

Messages:
* Structure - When there have been changes to the layout of files. This will include the removal & moving of files within the repo.
* Package - When a course has been completed and the files are being added to the repo.
* Documentation - When a files that does not contain any code & just contains information is being added to the repo.
