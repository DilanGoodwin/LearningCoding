Each of the videos within this section gives an introduction to their different concepts and explains to the user how they can be used. End of the videos there is a small challenge for the user to complete to show they have understood what the video was about.
Small quiz at the end of the section is made of 5 questions that are all based on things that have been taught in the videos throughout the section. The score you get from the quiz does not affect any part of the learning process it is more for consolidation than anything else.

Rather than learning new concepts within this section it is more about expanding on concepts that were taught within the previous section. There are some new bits that you learn like importing `random` but you mainly work on things that have already been talked about.

# Thoughts
This course is very much for beginners as the tutorial doesn't even require you to install Python3 onto your device with all of it being done online. If you want a quick introduction to Python3 or even a faster refresher on the language this is the course that I would recommend.
However, while it is a good building block not everuthing you need to know is there, so if you want a more advanced understainding of the language I would recommend going with something else or even to take this course but also look at another one that is more intermediate focused.
