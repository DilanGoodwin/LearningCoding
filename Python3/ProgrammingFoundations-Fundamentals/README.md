# Programming Foundations: Fundamentals

This is storing all of the programs created when following along with the LinkedIn Learning tutorial called Programming Foundations: Fundamentals. The course was more informational about programming in general & the concepts behind it rather than the actual language that was being used, in this tutorial the language used was Python3.

## What I Learnt in this Course
Going through this course was alright, as you can probably see from this Git reop I have some basic knowledge of programming (not that much) so going back to the basics was nice. Within each of the videos there are little points where they call attention to definitions (some of which are listed below because they are good) which I never had when learning programming.

Following along with this course, making the occasional notes didn't really feel like learning for me it was a little more like consolidation. I'll expand on what I mean, because some of the things within the course were not knew they were just being explained in a different way it helped grow my understanding of the concepts I already knew & the ones that I didn't were explained to me just as well.

Defintions to remember:
* Programming - Process converting ideas into instructions that computer understands & executes.
* Bug - Something unexpected happens.
* Crash - Stops early or freezes.
* Syntax - Rules programming language.
* Source Code - Computer instructions written plain text.
* IDE - Integrated Development environment, enhanced text editor offering features speed up code development. 
* Statements - Building blocks programming language 
* Operatotrs - Symbols tell computer perform action with an input.
* Syntax Error - Error indicating you somehow broke the rules of the language.
* Runtime Error - Error indicating computer was unable execute protion code.
* Semantic Error - Error indicating output program not what you expected.
* Variable - Container for value.
* Keywords - Reserved words mean something special programming language.
* Float - Any number with decimal point.
* Strings - How deal text within program.
* Comment - Text written plain text starting special character.
* Conditional or Boolean Expression - Expression breaks down either true or false.
* Function - Block code packaged together with name.
* Parameters - Allow functions change their behaviour based some input.
* Arguments - Name used values given to functions.
* Library - Groupnig variables and function someone else written and verified.

## Do I Recommend this Course
Course is all about the fundamentals of programming in general, so if you have never programmed before & would like to get into the space then this is a great start. But, if you have done some programming before & understand the 'fundamental' concepts of computer programming then this is one that you can skip as you'll probably pick more up from an indepth guide of a specific programming language.

That is not a bad thing though as that is what the course was going for. It was (& still is) aimed at complete beginners, people with no knowledge of the programming space. I personally took this course because one that I was interesting in taking on LinkedIn Learning recommended to do it before taking it on.

All in all, it was a good stop gap.
