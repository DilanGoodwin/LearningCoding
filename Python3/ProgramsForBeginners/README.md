# Programs For Beginners

A list of different programs that are great ideas for beginners to attempt to program within Python 3. The different programs will be explained to a small degree & then the programs will be created within the folder under the same name as the section title.

## PositiveOrNegative
Create a Python 3 program that accepts a user input & then tells the user whether the number is positive or negative sending the result to the terminal. 

## EvenAndOdd
Python 3 program accepts user input & then tells the user if the inputted number is odd or even.

## Greatest3Numbers
This program takes 3 numbers as user input & then prints the number that is the greatest out of all 3 of them to the terminal screen.

### Modifications
The Greatest3Numbers program could be modified to instead print the numbers in order from smallest to largest.

## CheckDivNumb
Program that takes in 2 numbers from the user & checks to see if the numbers when divided by one another would produce a whole number.

## MathCalculations
Program that takes in numbers & completes all of the basic mathematical functions:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

## CountTo10
Create Python program that counts from 1 to 10.

### Modifications 
Make it so the program takes in a user input & counts from the users input to 10. If the inputted number is greater than 10 then the program should count down rather than counting up.
