# Bash Shell Scripting

Simple shell scripts that complete basic functions that it would take a lot longer to complete manually.

## ScalaBlankProject.sh
This is a simple program that takes 2 pieces of user input. First tells the program where you would like the file to be stored & the second is the name of the file. This program automatically creates all the files that go along with a Scala project file that is going to be used within Visual Studio Code. </n></n>
Doing it this way allows me to pre-add the Scala JUnit testing library along with Scala Test library. 

## ScalaUniversityFolder.sh
This was a one time program that I used to batch make the different Scala project files for University. It copied a single instance of a Scala project file, only renaming it to the different weeks which the projects were for. 

## DocTmpFolder.sh
Creates a temporary folder called 'tmp' within the Documents folder. The program will also remove the tmp folder when it is run & re-create it.
